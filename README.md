# LV-EBM-for-Handwriting-Recognition
Using a Latent Variable Energy-Based Model for Handwriting Recognition. This tiny project followed as a personal proof-of-concept after a series of lectures by Yann LeCun and Alfredo Canziani on LV-EBMs. 
This work was planned by me, in terms of architectural design choices, and general logical flow.
However, I employed the help of Gemini to write the Syntax.
